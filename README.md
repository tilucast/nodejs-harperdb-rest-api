<h1>HarperDB NodeJS REST API</h1>

# About this repository

I saw this post <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/build-a-rest-api-with-node-js-and-harperdb-5d5b4cf06c91">Click Me</a> about this DB service called <a href="https://harperdb.io/">HarperDB</a>, the author was building a REST API with Node using this lib called <a href="https://github.com/chandan-24/Harperive">Harperive</a>, i followed his tutorial, and here we are.

It is a simple CRUD application built just to demonstrate how to use HarperDB with Node.
HarperDB has a free plan, so you can get a good grasp on how it works before actually buying anything. 

# Configurations

You can follow this tutorial : https://levelup.gitconnected.com/build-a-rest-api-with-node-js-and-harperdb-5d5b4cf06c91 on how to create a account and to get your personal database.

I'm not gonna explain everything since the tutorial linked above does a good job doing that.

run **npm install** to download all the dependencies needed to run this project.
**yarn dev/ npm run dev** to initiate the server on port 3333.

I'm using <a href="https://insomnia.rest/">Insomnia</a> to perform HTTP requests.
I uploaded my insomnia configs for this project. All you need to do is import those configs on your own insomnia.
